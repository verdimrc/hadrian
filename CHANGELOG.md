**After tag v0.1.0:**

  * Modified stat.sample.updateEWMA so that a variance is not required in the state record (Hadrian and Titus).

  * Loosened stat.sample.updateEWMA so that alpha=0 and alpha=1 are allowed (Hadrian and Titus).

  * Added stat.sample.updateHoltWinters, stat.sample.updateHoltWintersPeriodic, stat.sample.forecast1HoltWinters, and stat.sample.forecastHoltWinters to do double and triple exponential smoothing of a time-series (Hadrian and Titus).

  * Added a.rotate, a generally useful array function that is specifically useful as a stand-in for stat.sample.updateHoltWintersPeriodic with missing values.

(If you do change and get new value in two statements, the second might have been modified by another scoring engine.)

**After tag v0.4.0:**

  * Added model.cluster.randomSeeds, kmeansIteration, and updateMean for online clustering (Hadrian, Titus, and PFA).

  * Added access to name, version (if present), metadata, actionsStarted, and actionsFinished in begin, action, and end, where applicable (Hadrian, Titus, and PFA).

  * Added map.* primitives (Hadrian, Titus, and PFA).

  * Changed some a.* names to be consistent with the corresponding m.* names (Hadrian, Titus, and PFA).

**After tag v0.5.2:**
