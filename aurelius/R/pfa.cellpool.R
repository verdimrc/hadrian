#' pfa.cell
#'
#' Creates a list-of-lists representing a PFA cell.

#' @param init cell initial value, which is a list-of-lists, usually converted from a model
#' @param source if "embedded", the init is the data structure, if "json", the init is a URL string pointing to an external JSON file
#' @param shared if TRUE, the cell is shared across scoring engine instances
#' @param rollback if TRUE, the cell's value would be rolled back if an uncaught exception is encountered
