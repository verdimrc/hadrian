#' avro.typemap
#'
#' Convenience function for ensuring that Avro type schemas are declared exactly once. It returns a function that yields a full type declaration the first time it is invoked and just a name on subsequent times.
#' @param ... key-value pairs of Avro type schemas
#' @return a function that yields Avro type schemas or just their names
#' @export avro.typemap
#' @examples
#' tm <- avro.typemap(
#'     MyType1 = avro.record(list(one = avro.int, two = avro.double, three = avro.string)),
#'     MyType2 = avro.array(avro.double)
#' )
#' tm("MyType1")           # produces the whole declaration
#' tm("MyType1")           # produces just "MyType1"
#' tm("MyType2")           # produces the whole declaration
#' tm("MyType2")           # produces the declaration again because this is not a named type
